## World Map by Year

Here is a visualization of suicide rate throughout the globe.  

We can see by the colors that the differences between the suicide rate in different countries are large in the beginning of the 2000s, but they become smaller later on.  

```{r emb_shiny_dir_map, echo=F, warning=F}
shiny::shinyAppDir(
  appDir = "myshinyapp_map",
  options = list(
    width = "100%" , height = 650
  )
)
```
  


## By Country

Perhaps explaining the trend of the differences, different coutries have very diverse patterns of suicide rate over the years.

Here you can view suicide rate over the years in each country. 

```{r emb_shiny_dir_graph, echo=F, warning=F}
shiny::shinyAppDir(
  appDir = "myshinyapp_graph",
  options = list(
    width = "100%", height = 550
  )
)
```
